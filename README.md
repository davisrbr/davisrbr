## I'm Davis Brown

I do deep learning work and research in the Math of Machine Learning group at PNNL. I'm particularly interested in interpretability, adversarial examples, and semi-supervised learning. 

I'm also into effective altruism, a huge Robert Caro fan, and have been recently diving deep into what philosophy has to say about concepts (inspired by [this Brandom talk](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-444/paper13.pdf)!).

If any of this interests you, drop me a line at {first name}{last name}r@gmail.com, [twitter](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr), or [curius](https://curius.app/davis-brown).

### üî® Some (more or less) recent projects

- An interpretability library. Code [here](https://github.com/pnnl/DeepDataProfiler) and accompanying [streamlit demo](https://share.streamlit.io/pnnl/deepdataprofiler/frontend/main_streamlit.py).

- An app (now on TestFlight!) that converts an image of a bookshelf to a list of books. [Sign up here](https://lookshelf.app/).

- Putting lights on houses with unpaired image-to-image translation. [Demo here](https://share.streamlit.io/davisrbr/holiday-lights/main/main.py).

- Working with UNC-CH admin to model students on campus for fall 2020 restart scenarios. Find the [website here](https://davisrbr.github.io/fall2020unc/).

- Implementing the (discrete) Quantum Random Walk search algorithm. [Notebook here](https://github.com/nickk124/quantumsearch/blob/master/random_walk_search.ipynb).
