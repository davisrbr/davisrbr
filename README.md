[Let me know](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr) if you have feedback/interest!

**I do** a lot of computer vision work, and have also worked at the intersection of machine learning and geospatial research. I have a growing interest in interpretability as well! I am currently a Post-Bachelors in the Math of Machine Learning at PNNL. 

If any of this interests you (or you just want to talk physics, philosophy, statistics, EA, etc.), don't hesitate to drop me a line on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr).
