## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Davis Brown - davisrbr

### Some stuff I built in the last ~month:

- Modeling students on the UNC-CH campus for a fall 2020 restart scenarios. Find the website [here](https://davisrbr.github.io/fall2020unc/)

- Implementing the (discrete) Quantum Random Walk search algorithm. Notebook [here](https://github.com/nickk124/quantumsearch/blob/master/random_walk_search.ipynb)

### Something I'm currrently working on:

- [A project](https://github.com/davisrbr/bookRecognition) with the goal of converting an image of a bookshelf to a list of books.

**I do** a lot of computer vision work, and also work at the intersection of machine learning and geospatial research. If any of this interests you (or just want to talk physics, philosophy, statistics, effective altruism, etc.), don't hesitate to drop me a line on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr).
