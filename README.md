[Let me know](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr) if you have feedback/interest!

I'm currently doing deep learning work and research in the Math of Machine Learning at PNNL. I'm particularly interested in interpretability, adversarial examples, and semi-supervised learning.

If any of this interests you (or you just want to talk physics, philosophy, stats, machine learning, EA, etc.), don't hesitate to drop me a line on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr).
