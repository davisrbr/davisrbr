### ðŸ”¨ Some (more or less) recent projects and papers

- An app (now on TestFlight!) that converts an image of a bookshelf to a list of books. [Sign up here](https://lookshelf.app/).

- On the Symmetries of Deep Learning Models and their Internal Representations. [Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14258).
 
- An attack on concept-based interpretability methods for deep learning. [Arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07120). In AdvML Frontiers @ ICML 2022.

- An interpretability library. Code on [here](https://github.com/pnnl/DeepDataProfiler) and accompanying [streamlit demo](https://share.streamlit.io/pnnl/deepdataprofiler/frontend/main_streamlit.py).

- Putting lights on houses with unpaired image-to-image translation. [Demo here](https://share.streamlit.io/davisrbr/holiday-lights/main/main.py).

- I worked with UNC admin to model students on the campus for fall restart scenarios. Find the [website here](https://davisrbr.github.io/fall2020unc/).

- Implemented the (discrete) Quantum Random Walk search algorithm. [Notebook here](https://github.com/nickk124/quantumsearch/blob/master/random_walk_search.ipynb).


[Let me know](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr) if you have feedback/interest!

I'm currently doing deep learning work and research in the Math of Machine Learning at PNNL. I'm particularly interested in interpretability, adversarial examples, and semi-supervised learning.

If any of this interests you (or you just want to talk physics, philosophy, stats, machine learning, EA, etc.), don't hesitate to drop me a line on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/davisbrownr).
